      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello world! My name is Nathan Smith and I'm a junior at Penn State University studying Information Sciences and Technology. I'm also an active member of Cru at Penn State, as well
        as the IST Web Consulting Group. I'm passionate about music and technology, and in my free time I like to lead worship with Cru, play music, and mountain bike. Recently I've also
        discovered my love for web design and development, and I've been leaning into learning more about that. I hope that through this website you're able to stay updated on my blog, as
        well as on any music or web projects I might be working on!
