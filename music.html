      <p>
        In the summer of 2015 I was a worship arts intern at my home church, Willowdale Chapel. That year we
        began digging in to what it might look like to utilize the various artistic giftings of the members
        of our congregation. The result was a short Christmas EP written and composed by members of the church,
        and everything was recorded and produced by Ryan Dowdall. My role in this process was that I helped
        write the lyrics for the song "Emmanuel", which you can listen to below. I did not, however, play on the
        album at all.

      <p>
        In 2012, my high school band recorded a short EP of originals that we had written. The band was made up of
        a few close friends from my church. In the recordings, I played rhythm guitar and sang the lead vocals.
        Shortly after recording the EP we all went our separate ways, but Ryan Dowdall (the lead guitarist) and I
        still hang out and write music as we're able to.
