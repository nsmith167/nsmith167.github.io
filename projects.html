      In the fall of 2016 I took an intermediate object-oriented design course. It was taught in
      Java, and focused on really honing our ability to design good, object-oriented software. The
      final project was assigned as a way of allowing us to use and showcase a few of the concepts
      taught in the course. I worked with two other students and built a simple snake game that relies
      heavily on Java Swing. Parts of the project use an MVC framework, and my team designed a very
      simple way of saving data using a text file. The part of this project that I contributed to
      the most was the actual game engine itself, while my teammates did an amazing job with the
      score-saving system and the look and feel of the overall program. The GitHub repository width
      all of our code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/nsmith167/FinalProject.git">here</a>.

      In the summer of 2016 I decided it'd be great to build my own website. After being a member of
      Penn State's IST Web Consulting Group for a semester, web design and development had caught my
      attention, and I figured a great way to learn more about it all would be to code a static website
      from scratch. The result was the website that you're now viewing! Everything is built with HTML
      and CSS, and I didn't use any external CSS libraries or HTML templates. For hosting, I found
      that the site could be easily hosted from GitHub, so I went with that as a short-term free solution.
      The other great benefit to this is that you can easily view my code. And I'd love feedback
      on my code! Web development is still something I'm learning about, and I know my work is far from
      perfect. So head over to my <a href="https://github.com/nsmith167/nsmith167.github.io">GitHub</a> account, check out my code,
      and send me an email with any feedback you'd like to provide. It'd mean a ton!
