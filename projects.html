      <h2>2016</h2>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2016 I decided it'd be great to build my own website. After being a member of
        Penn State's IST Web Consulting Group for a semester, web design and development had caught my
        attention, and I figured a great way to learn more about it all would be to code a static website
        from scratch. The result was the website that you're now viewing! Everything is built with HTML
        and CSS, and I didn't use any external CSS libraries or HTML templates. For hosting, I found
        that the site could be easily hosted from GitHub, so I went with that as a short-term free solution.
        The other great benefit to this is that you can easily view my code. And I'd love feedback
        on my code! Web development is still something I'm learning about, and I know my work is far from
        perfect. So head over to my <a href="http://github.com/nsmith167">GitHub</a> account, check out my code,
        and send me an email with any feedback you'd like to provide. It'd mean a ton!
